# Pricing Optimization Project

## Overview
This project focuses on optimizing pricing for a burger café by analyzing sales data and price elasticity. The goal is to determine the ideal prices for menu items to maximize revenue.

## Dataset
The analysis uses three CSV files:
- **Cafe_Sell_MetaData.csv**: Contains metadata about the café's menu items.
- **Cafe_Transaction_Store.csv**: Includes historical sales transactions.
- **Cafe_DateInfo.csv**: Provides date-related information for the transactions.

## Objectives
1. Calculate price elasticity for each item.
2. Identify optimal prices based on the calculated elasticity.
3. Merge datasets and prepare them for machine learning algorithms using Pandas.
4. Visualize the data using matplotlib and seaborn.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Run the analysis script to explore pricing strategies.
